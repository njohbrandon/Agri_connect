## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Project Overview
Agri-Connect is a web-based platform designed to bridge the gap between farmers and buyers. [cite: 1, 91] It provides an easy-to-use, mobile-accessible interface where farmers can register and list their agricultural products (e.g., vegetables, fruits), including details like type, quality, price, and location. [cite: 2, 92] Buyers can browse or search for these products, view detailed information, and obtain contact details for farmers to facilitate purchases. [cite: 3, 93]

### 1.2 Goals and Objectives

**For Farmers:**
* Provide a simple platform to showcase products to a wider audience. [cite: 4, 94]
* Enable easy management of product listings. [cite: 5, 95]
* Increase market reach and potential sales. [cite: 5, 95]

**For Buyers:**
* Offer a convenient way to find local agricultural products. [cite: 6, 96]
* Provide detailed product information including quality, price, and farmer contact. [cite: 6, 96]

**Overall Platform:**

### 1.3 Target Audience

**Primary Users:**
* Farmers: Small to medium-scale farmers looking to sell their produce directly. [cite: 9, 99]
* Buyers: Individual consumers, small businesses (restaurants, local grocers), or wholesalers looking for fresh produce. [cite: 10, 100]

**Technical Proficiency:** Users are expected to have basic smartphone/web literacy. [cite: 11, 101] The platform must be simple enough for users with limited technical skills. [cite: 12, 102]

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Technology Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla JS or a lightweight library like jQuery if needed), Bootstrap 5 (for responsive design and UI components). [cite: 21, 111]
* **Backend:** PHP (latest stable version). [cite: 22, 112]
* **Database:** MySQL (via XAMPP for local development, and a compatible MySQL server for production). [cite: 22, 112]
* **Web Server:** Apache (via XAMPP for local development). [cite: 23, 113]

### 2.2 High-Level Architecture

The platform will follow a traditional client-server architecture: [cite: 23, 113]

* **Client-Side (Browser):** Users interact with HTML pages styled with CSS (Bootstrap) and enhanced with JavaScript for dynamic behavior (e.g., form validation, AJAX requests). [cite: 24, 114]
* **Server-Side (PHP):** PHP scripts handle business logic: [cite: 24, 114]
    * Processing user requests (e.g., form submissions). [cite: 25, 115]
    * Interacting with the MySQL database (CRUD operations). [cite: 25, 115]
    * User authentication and session management for farmers. [cite: 25, 115]
    * Serving dynamic content to the client. [cite: 26, 116]
* **Database (MySQL):** Stores all persistent data, such as farmer profiles and product listings. [cite: 26, 116]
